This finding is triggered when a user or role attempts to assign a highly permissive policy to themselves. If the user or role in question is not meant to have administrative privileges, either the user's credentials may be compromised or the role's permissions may not be configured properly. In an effort to maximize their ability to access your account, even after they have been discovered, attackers can use stolen credentials or a misconfigured role to escalate their privileges and then create new users, add access policies to existing users, create access keys, etc.\n",
